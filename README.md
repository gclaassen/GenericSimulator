# Managed Control System (Obsolete)

This was my first attempt at a message control middleware library. The library was written in Javascript in the node.js environment.
The library is obsolete, but it stays here as a reminder of where I began and what we accomplished up to this point.
I hope to open-source the control framework in the near future.
